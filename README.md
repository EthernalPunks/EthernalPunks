## Ethernal Punks

Ethernal Punks is one of the first 10k Recursive ethernal collections. The original Punks are being recreated by combining different pre-inscribed traits. Mint is 100% free. Find the punk you want in the SVG folder and inscribe the SVG file to claim it.

**Note: On June 28, 2023, at 10:00 AM UTC, all SVGs will be released in this repository.**

### How to check if a Recursive Punks is already inscribed?

Use the Hash Check tool to check if the SVG were already inscribed. Hash Check tool: [https://ethernals.org/create](https://ethernals.org/create)

### How do these 'recursive inscriptions' work?

All punk traits have been inscribed in Ethernals ([view them here](https://ethernals.org/address/0x7cdfba60cffc031a3fae2f5f5c4b23b4903f15e0)).
These traits are being combined into a new inscription to regenerate the original punks into an svg file.
